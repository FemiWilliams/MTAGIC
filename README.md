Mobile Touch And Gesture Interaction for Children (MTAGIC) is a joint research project between Bowie State University and University of Maryland Baltimore County and is funded by the National Science Foundation. Its purpose is to collect and analyze data on how children interact with touchscreen applications. My involvement with the project was creating the android app used to collect data from children's interactions with it.
